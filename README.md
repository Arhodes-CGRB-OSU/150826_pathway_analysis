While generating transcriptomes and getting counts can be a fun and exciting part of RNA-Seq Analysis, we really want to have results to show us what our genes are doing differently between our control and our treatments.

An important part of RNA-Seq Analysis is finding out the names of genes and functional pathways that are associated with them.

This tutorial demonstrates another differential expression package in R, called Gage, that provides some insights into affected pathways using Pathview in R.

###During this session you will learn about:

1. Use of GAGE package to do pathway analysis

   a. "Native workflow"
        
   b. Combined workflow with RNAseq
        
2. Interpret the GAGE output 

3. Use of Pathview to visualize the perturbed KEGG pathways
